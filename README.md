# Bio Masker

## Overview

This repository contains a Semantic Segmenter designed to identify and mask high foliage areas within top-down drone images. The model utilizes deep learning techniques to perform pixel-level segmentation, classifying each pixel as either foliage or non-foliage. This is particularly useful for tasks such as environmental monitoring, precision agriculture, and land cover analysis.
